# Solodrop Theme License Validation

This repository is to exclusively hold the source file for the Solodrop.js theme license validation. This file exists within the Solodrop's theme source code, but the customer facing version of this file is obfuscated. When a change is made to this file, the source should be pushed to this repo and then the obfuscated version should be updated in the theme's source code.
